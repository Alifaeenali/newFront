                    <p>FortiFund is a deal-matching platform that connects brokered deals to the right lenders based on underwriting criteria — automatically, efficiently, and securely. It is not a CRM.</p>

                    How is FortiFund different from a CRM?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>CRMs help manage contacts and communication. FortiFund helps you close more deals by matching submissions with lenders that actually fund your deals — without the admin hassle.</p>

                    <p>Not yet — but we’re getting there. Right now, FortiFund matches your deal with the most relevant lenders based on their criteria and your preferences. Once matched, you’ll still send the deal to the lender yourself, just like you normally would — but with more confidence that it’s the right fit. We’re actively working on features that will let you send and track deals directly through the platform.</p>

                    <p>No. FortiFund doesn’t blast your deals out. Instead, we use precision matching to identify the single best-fit lender for each deal — based on underwriting criteria, your preferences, and even commission structures. This gives you the confidence to send your deal to just one lender, which:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increases your chance of getting the deal funded,</li>
                        <li>Helps you earn the highest commissions possible, and</li>
                        <li>Eliminates the risk of your deal being backdoored or overexposed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You stay in full control — once you receive a match, you send the deal directly, just like you normally would.</p>
